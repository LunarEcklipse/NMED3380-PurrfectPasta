# Purrfect Pasta
A little game I made in 3 days for a class as part of a game-jam style assignment. Our prompt was "Eat".

You control a cat chef who runs a restaurant for other cats. You select the ingredients on the right, and use them to build the dishes for your customers.

This has bugs, especially in the fully built version of the game. After one reset, dishes and customers don't always clear properly. Unfortunately these bugs I didn't really have too much time to fix. I may return to it and fix them all later, but for the time being I just want to show the code work and move on to the next project. These deadlines come up really fast!

I made this in conjunction with two classmates, Lauren Gulka and Melanie Oslie. They did the art for this. Thanks guys!

This was built for Unity 6, specifically 6000.0.19f1. It was a pretty neat update from 2023!
